# CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The projects for this course aimed to provide hands-on experience with various data structures, allowing us as students to see the differences in their implementation and functionality. We first learned about how each data structure uniquely stores and sorts data in the system. Then, we went through the steps of programming them and further decomposed them line by line to understand their run-time functionality.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
It's crucial to understand how data structures handle data because in large programs with vast amounts of data, choosing the right data structure can significantly impact the system's functionality. Proper selection of data structures can improve efficiency, speed, and overall performance.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
One of the biggest challenges was working with someone else's code. Trying to break down the thought processes of another person and see where they were heading with their program required a deep understanding of the code and the data structure. Thankfully, we had many insightful comments guiding us, although they didn't always lead in the direction I expected.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This course and the projects within it have shown me that programming involves much more than just getting a program to compile and produce an alphabetical list. Analyzing different data structures and comparing their runtime complexity, space complexity, and the efficiency of common operations like insertions or deletions revealed that there isn't always a clear winner. This realization has deepened my understanding of the analytical aspect of programming.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This course has broadened my view of programming, giving me a deeper understanding of what makes a program functional and effective for a given purpose. Now, in addition to recognizing the elements of different data structures, I can also evaluate why a particular data structure was chosen and what benefits it brings to the system. This understanding helps me write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
